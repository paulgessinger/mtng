    "body": "Currently, we are multiplying an 8x8 covariance matrix with an 8x8 transport matrix, and we see that Eigen is failing to optimize this properly, because it is calling a generalized GEMM method rather than an optimized small matrix method. In order to resolve this, we change the code to use a tiled multiplication method which splits the matrices into 4x4 sub-matrices which can be multiplied and added to achieve the desired effect. This has two advantages:\r\n\r\n  1. It allows Eigen to use its hand-rolled optimized 4x4 matrix multiplication methods.\r\n  2. It allows us to perform some trickery with matrix identities to reduce the number of floating point operations.\r\n",
