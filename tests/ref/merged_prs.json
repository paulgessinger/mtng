refactor the `MultiEigenStepperLoop` and fixes a situation, where a few stepping-erros could break the whole propagation.\r\n- **Fix:** If some components had stepping errors and all other components where on a surface, the propagation terminated\r\n- **Refactor:**\r\n  - remove internal logger from `MultiEigenStepperLoop` since it is not really configurable from outside\r\n  - improve `MultiEigenStepperLoop::step` (only construct summary-string in `VERBOSE` mode or on error, remove unnecessary loops and vectors, move things to lambdas, ...)\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** This does not fix the reason why stepping errors occur in some situations, this (hopefully) will be done in a subsequent PR)", "created_at": "2022-08-05T06:34:55Z", "updated_at": "2022-08-10T12:32:30Z", "closed_at":

`RootBFieldWriter` to write out the correct binning. The file can now be read back in for identical result.\r\n  * Don't write out phi bins for the `(R,z)` field map, since there is no place for the phi coordinate in the root file. Uses `phi=0`.\r\n  * In principle, this code is supposed to allow writing 2D or 3D file format, whether the source is `(R,z)` or `(x,y,z)`. I don't know if this is useful, and I haven't tested it.\r\n* Tidy up BField reading in `FieldMapRootIo.cpp` and `BFieldMapUtils.cpp`\r\n* Add `pytest` `test_bfield_writing`. This uses an expanded `bfield_writing.py` example to:\r\n  1. create a 2T `acts.SolenoidBField`\r\n  2. write it out as an `(R,z)` field-map to `solenoid.root`\r\n  3. read it back in from `solenoid.root`\r\n  4. write it again to `solenoid2.root`\r\n  5. check that both files have the correct (identical) number of entries and `root_file_hashes.txt`.\r\n    * Note: The two files should be identical, but don't have the same `root_file_hashes.txt`.\r\n    * I have checked that they have the same entries using `root` `solenoid->Scan(\"*\")`.\r\n\r\nThe test doesn't check the `(x,y,z)` field-map I/O, but I have tested read/write gives identical results with the ITk field-map.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the problems I reported in #669. @osbornjd, please check if it fixes your issues too.",

think: when `pLimit == cLimit + s_onSurfaceTolerance`, then the intersection is not accepted, but there is also no message printed out, because it is only checkt for `<` and `>`, but one should be `<=` or `>=` in this case I think.\r\n\r\n2) With the `s_onSurfaceTolerance`, I think we do not compare what we accually want here anymore:\r\n\r\n   What we check is something like `a*a < b*b + c`, but what we (I think) want to check is `|a| < |b| + c`. This is obviously not the same (e.g. with a=4, b=3, c=2).\r\n\r\n   So I know also added `std::abs` in the computation of the `accept`-boolean. Not sure if that is the best way, since it seems that was not done for performance reasons or something like that before. One could also change the verbose message to print out the actual criterion...", "created_at": "2022-08-04T13:39:00Z", "updated_at": "2022-08-05T06:19:27Z", "closed_at": "2022-08-05T06:19:23Z",

the KF when the backward\r\nsmoothing propagation is enabled. It's possible this only occurs with a\r\nbeampipe layer.\r\n\r\nI **think** what's happening is two things:\r\n- The on-surface tolerance wasn't applied correctly in one location (I think we do this in other spots, like when we're looking for compatible layers in volumes, and compatible surfaces in layers.)\r\n- If we actually have a target surface (and it's still reachable), this\r\n  navigation state is probably still valid. We are on the final layer,\r\n  the navigator realizes it won't find the perigee surfaces through the\r\n  tracking geometry. It looks up the volume from the target surface\r\n  position, and determines that we are in fact in the target volume\r\n  already, so it only needs to *proceed to target* to be done.\r\n\r\nAs a tentative solution I've included the `s_onSurfaceTolerance` in the\r\ncheck in `SteppingHelper` (@asalzburger can you advise if that seems\r\ncorrect here?), and split the output into a warning in case there is no\r\ntarget surface (which I still think is a bug/edge case we should warn on), and a verbose messagge in case we do have it.\r\n\r\nOne could supplement the last change by checking if at this point the\r\ntarget surface is still reachable, but I'm not sure this should be done\r\nonly for reason of providing output.", "created_at": "2022-08-03T13:16:48Z", "updated_at":

They may not be reconstructed and certainly won't be included in the efficiency calculation, but do provide more realistic hits in the detector to test the pattern recognition. @asalzburger suggested Fatras should still be able to cope with 150 MeV.\r\n\r\nNote, that this is in code that is commented out in the example script.

all other components where on a surface, the propagation terminated\r\n- **Refactor:**\r\n  - remove internal logger from `MultiEigenStepperLoop` since it is not really configurable from outside\r\n  - improve `MultiEigenStepperLoop::step` (only construct summary-string in `VERBOSE` mode or on error, remove unnecessary loops and vectors, move things to lambdas, ...)\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** This does not fix the reason why stepping errors occur in some situations, this (hopefully) will be done in a subsequent PR)", "created_at": "2022-07-25T12:52:03Z", "updated_at": "2022-08-05T06:34:35Z",

"body": "This PR changes the DD4hep integration model. Instead of the DD4hep factory code having to depend on ACTS or the ActsDD4hep glue lib, they now use a mechanism we merged into DD4hep (as of `1.21`): [`MapStringVariantStruct`](https://dd4hep.web.cern.ch/dd4hep/reference/structdd4hep_1_1rec_1_1MapStringVariantStruct.html), which is wrapped into a detector element *extension* as `VariantParameters`.\r\n\r\nThis extension is independent of ACTS and encodes key value pairs, with the keys being strings and the values being any of string, int, float or bool. ACTS will use information attached to detector elements via this mechanism to identify layers, surface axes and material properties (layer and boundary).\r\n\r\nThis PR also removes the need to active subdetectors to be marked up using a specific extension: using the DD4hep `DetType` enum, ACTS will look for detector elements flagged `TRACKER` and `BARREL`, `ENDCAP` or `BEAMPIPE` and handle them accordingly. Passive structures that cannot be flagged with the above use a *variant* parameter `passive_layer` to tell ACTS to translate them.\r\n\r\n## Possible parameters ACTS will interpret\r\n\r\nACTS geometry translation uses parameters attached to DD4hep detector elements via the `VariantParameters` extension. You can set this extension from your factory code, or use DD4hep's plugin mechanism to set parameters on detector elements via name. Here's an excerpt from the Open Data Detector on how to use this to mark a passive structure as a *passive layer*:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<lccdd>\r\n  <detectors>\r\n    <detector id=\"ODD_Solenoid_ID\" name=\"Solenoid\" type=\"ODDCylinder\" beampipe=\"false\" vis=\"Aluminum\">\r\n      <type_flags type=\"DetType_TRACKER\" />\r\n      <boundary_material surface=\"inner\" binning=\"binPhi,binZ\" bins0=\"mat_sol_bPhi\" bins1=\"mat_sol_bZ\"/>\r\n      <tubs name=\"Solenoid\" rmin=\"sol_rmin\" rmax=\"sol_rmax\" dz=\"sol_hlength\" material=\"Aluminum\">\r\n        <layer_material surface=\"representing\" binning=\"binPhi,binZ\" bins0=\"mat_sol_bPhi\" bins1=\"mat_sol_bZ\"/>\r\n      </tubs>\r\n    </detector>\r\n  </detectors>\r\n\r\n  <plugins>\r\n    <plugin name=\"DD4hep_ParametersPlugin\">\r\n      <argument value=\"Solenoid\"/>\r\n      <argument value=\"passive_layer: bool = true\"/>\r\n    </plugin>\t\r\n  </plugins>\r\n</lccdd>\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Layer\r\n\r\n  * `envelope_{r,z}_{min,max}`: explicit envelope for a layer\r\n  * `layer_material`: mark a layer as passive (use this if you want to add a passive layer that is not a beampipe)\r\n  * Surface binning:\r\n\r\n    * `surface_binning`: set to true to indicate that explicit surface binning is set.\r\n    * `surface_binning_n_{phi,r}`: surface binning for a layer\r\n\r\n  * Layer material:\r\n\r\n    * `layer_material`: set to true to indicate that the layer has layer material configuration\r\n\r\n      * `layer_material_representing`: set to true to indicate representing layer material\r\n      * `layer_material_inner`: set to true to indicate inner layer material\r\n      * `layer_material_outer`: set to true to indicate outer layer material\r\n      * `layer_material_{representing,inner,outer}_bin{X,Y,Z,R,Phi,RPhi,H,Eta,Mag}` to give the number of bins in a direction\r\n\r\n* Sensor\r\n\r\n  * `axis_definitions`: local axis definitions for a sensor.
